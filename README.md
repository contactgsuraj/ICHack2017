## IC Hack 2017

A Smart pillow for the future generations. A prototype build in approximately 24 hours for a hackathon

### Details

A hand built pressure sensor is hooked up to a raspberry pi. All of these have been house in a hand craft wood case! The Raspberry pi's GPIO pins are connected to these handmade pressure sensors. The raspberry pi runs a Bluetooth RFComm server. The android application connects to this socket. There are some integrations with the android app and is highly extensible. As for now the android application has a live feed of the pillow and a heat map. A failed go at alarm clock integration also happened in the process.
